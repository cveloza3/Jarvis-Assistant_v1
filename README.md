Jarvis Tutorial

Here you will find the Jarvis tutorial project that uses a mix of DialogFlow, Web Speech API and other libraries such as BotUI to bring Jarvis to the web, for free, for everyone.

Credit goes to the respective API creators.

NOTES:

Installing Node.js can be confusing, frustrating and time consuming so I suggest you search 'install node.js on Windows/OSX/Linux'

This will only work in Chrome as it uses Google Speech Recognition

The first time you speak to Jarvis it may take a minute to connect to the Dialogflow Server thing.

To run this:

On Windows Powershell : 
    1. Set-Location YOUR-DIRECTORY-PATH-FOR-NODEJS/JARVIS
    2. node app.js
    
On Linux : 
    1. cd YOUR-DIRECTORY-PATH-FOR-NODEJS/JARVIS
    2. node app.js
    
FUTURE PLANS FOR THIS SYSTEM:
    1. Movie quotes - Jarvis will respond to things he is asked in the movie
    2. Weather, Time, Date - The boring bits!
    3. Arduino Compatability
    4. Database compatability for custom Node.js requests before it get's into Google's mits!
    4. Anything you guys request!
